# Pig Game 🎲

This is my implementation of the **Pig Game** as part of [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann.  
I was given the HTML, CSS, and some asset files, and I added all the **JavaScript functionality** myself.

## 📜 Game Rules

- The game has **two players**, taking turns.
- On each turn, a player rolls a die:
  - If the roll is **1**, the current score resets to 0 and the turn passes to the other player.
  - If the roll is **2–6**, the number is added to the current score.
- The player can choose to **“Hold”**:
  - The current score is added to their total score.
  - Turn passes to the other player.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins.

- Dice rolling and score updates
- Switching players on `1` roll or when holding
- Winning condition check
- Reset game functionality
